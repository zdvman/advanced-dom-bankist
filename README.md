# 💻 Advanced DOM Bankist

**Advanced DOM Bankist** is a modern, interactive banking landing page built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**. This project demonstrates proficiency in advanced DOM manipulation, event delegation, lazy loading, smooth UI transitions, and the use of modern browser APIs like `IntersectionObserver`.

It was developed as part of an educational journey to master frontend development and is ideal for showcasing DOM-related JavaScript skills in a portfolio.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project helped solidify the following frontend concepts:

- Writing modular, scalable JavaScript
- Using event delegation and event bubbling
- Creating and manipulating DOM elements dynamically
- Using `closest()`, `classList`, and `dataset` attributes
- Handling modal windows and keyboard events
- Scroll-based animations with `scrollIntoView`
- Lazy loading images with `IntersectionObserver`
- Creating sliders with dot and arrow navigation
- Managing state in the DOM (active tab, slide index, etc.)
- Adding and removing CSS classes dynamically

---

## 📌 Key JavaScript Techniques Demonstrated

- `addEventListener`, `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
- `.closest()`, `.classList.toggle()`, `.classList.add()`
- DOM traversal and manipulation
- Intersection Observer API for sticky nav and reveal sections
- Lazy loading images using `data-src`
- Arrow functions, destructuring, template literals
- DRY code practices and event delegation

---

## 📚 Ideal For

This project is perfect for:

- Frontend developers building their portfolios
- Students mastering JavaScript and DOM APIs
- Demonstrating understanding of UI interactivity and performance
- Practicing modular and readable JavaScript logic
